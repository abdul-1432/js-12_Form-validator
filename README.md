## Features

- Provides built-in validation rules for common use cases.
- Customizable error messages for each validation rule.
- Lightweight and dependency-free.

## Getting Started

### Installation

You can install the form validator library via npm:

```bash
npm install form-validator
```

Or you can include the script directly in your HTML:

```HTML
<script src="path/to/form-validator.js"></script>
```

### Usage

To use the form validator library, follow these steps:

1. Include the script in your HTML file:

   ```HTML
   <script src="path/to/form-validator.js"></script>
   ```

2. Create a new instance of the `FormValidator` class:

   ```javascript
   const form validator = new FormValidator();
   ```

3. Configure your form inputs and validation rules:

   ```javascript
   const validationConfig = {
     fields: [
       {
         name: 'name',
         rules: 'required|min:3',
         errorMessage: 'Please enter a valid name (minimum 3 characters).',
       },
       {
         name: 'email',
         rules: 'required|email',
         errorMessage: 'Please enter a valid email address.',
       },
       // Add more fields and rules as needed
     ],
   };
   ```

4. Attach the form validator to your form:

   ```javascript
   const form = document.getElementById('myForm');
   form.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
     event.preventDefault();

     if (form validator.validate form(form, validationConfig)) {
       // Form is valid, submit the form or perform additional actions
       form.submit();
     }
   });
   ```
